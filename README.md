#This is the summative assignment. It is an app that checks for assignment and deadlines. It then checks for students who have not yet submitted and reminds them. The config file contains all the variables used by app. The whole app revolves around the information provided in the submissions.txt file. It contains the student names, their assignments an whether or not they submitted. The reminder.sh script checks the submissions file and gives us the deadline for each assignment. The functions.sh script checks the submissions file to then display students which have assignments due and when it is due. Finally the startup.sh script starts the application.

#To run the app: Step 1: Clone the repository to your terminal. Step 2: Navigate to the Submission_reminder_larry directory. Step 3: If you need to change the students and assignments, navigate to the assets directory and there you can modify the submissions.txt file. Step 4: Navigate to the config directory to change variables and naviage to the app directory to change variables there too. Step 5:  Nvavigate back to subission_reminder_larry then run the startup.sh script. Done!
