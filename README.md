#This is the summative assignment. It is an app that checks for assignment and deadlines. It then checks for students who have not yet submitted and reminds them. The config file contains all the variables used by app. The whole app revolves around the information provided in the submissions.txt file. It contains the student names, their assignments an whether or not they submitted. The reminder.sh script checks the submissions file and gives us the deadline for each assignment. The functions.sh script checks the submissions file to then display students which have assignments due and when it is due. Finally the startup.sh script starts the application.
